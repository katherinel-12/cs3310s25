CS3310 Matrix Multiplication - Classic, Divide and Conquer, and Strassen's Method </br>
</br>
Some files have set matrices to compare results to ensure proper handling of the multiplication. The for loops can populate the matrices with random values, in this case random integers from 0:10. There is also an input.py file which can be adjusted briefly to handle matrices of 2^n size by specifying the size and then MatrixA and MatrixB afterwards. </br>
